1. Several haarcascades are tried
2. LEye and REye are written seperately

3. Grid lines integrated
4. Face/eye recognition is proper, apart from jerks of video frames in between
5. Face centre logic implemented. Need to cross verify in all cases.
6. Text is displayed as and when needed

7. findEyeCenter integrated properly. But cvtranspose is crashing saying mismatch in width and height

8. Working eyetrack. 
9. Left/Right eye detection code is placed in a macro as the processing is taking lot of time.
